# Weather Dashboard
This website provides current and forecast weather conditions.

## About This Repository
This website hosts a weather dashboard. Users can search by city to find the current and forecast weather for the next five days. Search history for the past eight queries is dynamically displayed in the left column, with more recent searches displayed at the top and no repeats. Users can click on search history entries to be shown updated weather information for that location.

This website provides current and forecast weather conditions.

## About This Repository
This website hosts a weather dashboard. Users can search by city to find the current and forecast weather for the next five days. Search history for the past eight queries is dynamically and non-repetitively displayed in the left column, with more recent searches displayed at the top. Users can click on search history entries to be shown updated weather information for that location.

### Bonus Features
Users can set their most recent search as the default city displayed on page load or they can reset searcg history at the click of a button!

//start basic structure using Boostrap grid
//send API requests to get location, (date?), current weather, weather for the next five days

//set up API request function
    //send an initial request and parse with JSON to determine what values are returned by general request (and how to access)
    //set up function to retrieve the hardcoded locations on the left (to practice how to retrieve, access, generate values and elements)
    //link to buttons on the left
    //set up function to dynamically retrieve weather data for user input using existing API request function (capture user input, trim text, add as API parameter)
//set up function to generate elements for current weather (for loop)
//set up function to loop through weather for next five days (add as a second parameter?)
//set up buttons using "data" property for hardcoded button list
//set up ability for user input to be captured in form element and dynamically displayed
//set up function to choose from a list of icons depending on the type of weather returned
//add finishing touches with Bootstrap/custom CSS
